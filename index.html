<h3>I am a 21 year old Computer Science major going to Oakland University trying to pursue my dreams of working remotely and traveling, in my free time I race jet skis and 
    also love to play basketball. I love anything to do with computers and just like tinkering witht them to see how everything works and also why they work. If you would like to
    know anything more about me check out my other pages!<h3>
